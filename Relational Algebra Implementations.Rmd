Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r setup}

library(DBI)
reuters <- dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), dbname = "reuters.db")

```



```{sql connection="reuters"}

SELECT count(*) FROM (
	SELECT term FROM frequency
	WHERE docid = '10398_txt_earn'
	AND count = 1
	UNION SELECT term FROM frequency
	WHERE docid = '925_txt_trade'
	AND count = 1);


```


Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
