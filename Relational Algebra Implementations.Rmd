```{r setup}

library(DBI)
reuters <- dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), dbname = "reuters.db")

```



Coursera exercise: Write an SQL statement that is equivalent to the following relational algebra expression: 

πterm(σdocid=10398_txt_earn and count=1(frequency)) U πterm(σdocid=925_txt_trade and count=1(frequency))


```{sql connection="reuters"}

SELECT count(*) FROM (
	SELECT term FROM frequency
	WHERE docid = '10398_txt_earn'
	AND count = 1
	UNION SELECT term FROM frequency
	WHERE docid = '925_txt_trade'
	AND count = 1);

```



Coursera exercise: Write an SQL statement to count the number of documents containing the word "parliament."

```{sql connection="reuters"}

SELECT count(*) FROM (
	SELECT docid FROM frequency
	WHERE term = 'law'
	AND count > 0
	UNION SELECT docid FROM frequency
	WHERE term = 'legal'
	AND count > 0);

```



Coursera exercise: Write an SQL statement to find all documents that have more than 300 total terms, including duplicate terms.

```{sql connection="reuters"}

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM (	
	SELECT docid, Total FROM (
		SELECT docid, SUM(count/count) as Total FROM frequency
		GROUP BY docid
		ORDER BY docid)
		WHERE Total > 300
);

```

Coursera exercise: Write an SQL statement to count the number of unique documents that contain both the word 'transactions' and the word 'world'.

```{sql connection="reuters"}

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM (
	
	SELECT docid From frequency
	WHERE TERM = 'transactions'
	
	INTERSECT
	
	SELECT docid From frequency
	WHERE TERM = 'world'
);

```
